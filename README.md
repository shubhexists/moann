# Moann

A lightweight, multithreaded alternative to Mechvibes for mechanical keyboard sound simulation, written in Rust. This CLI tool provides blazing-fast performance with minimal resource usage.

## Features

- âš¡ Lightning-fast response time through multithreading
- ðŸ¦€ Written in Rust for optimal performance and safety
- ðŸª¶ Minimal resource footprint
- ðŸŽ® Simple CLI interface
- ðŸŽ¹ Real-time keyboard sound feedback
- ðŸ’» Cross-platform support
- ðŸ”§ Zero configuration needed

## Installation

### From Source

Requires Rust toolchain (1.70.0 or newer):

```bash
cargo install moann
```

## Quick Start

Simply run the following command to start the keyboard sound simulation:

```bash
moann start
```

## System Requirements

- Any modern operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Audio output device
- Minimal storage space (~10MB)

## How It Works

Moann leverages Rust's powerful concurrency model to process keyboard events and play sounds with minimal latency:

1. Main thread: Handles user input and CLI interface
2. Event listener thread: Captures keyboard events using native OS APIs
3. Audio thread: Manages sound playback with minimal latency
4. Resource thread: Handles file system operations efficiently

This architecture ensures that sound playback never blocks keyboard input processing, resulting in a seamless experience.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sound not playing**
   - Ensure your system's audio is not muted
   - Check if the correct audio output device is selected
   - Verify that you have the required permissions

### Debug Mode

Run with debug logging enabled:

```bash
moann start --debug
```

### Building from Source

If you encounter any issues building from source, ensure you have:

1. Latest stable Rust toolchain
2. Required system dependencies:
   - Linux: `libasound2-dev`, `libxi-dev`and `libxtst-dev`
   ```
    sudo apt install libxi-dev libxtst-dev libasound2-dev
   ```
   - macOS: XCode command line tools
   - Windows: No additional dependencies
